🚀 My Journey
From an MBA in Human Resources to SA8000 certification, I’ve equipped myself with the tools needed to navigate the complex world of labor standards, compliance, and employee relations. My work spans internal audits, legal compliance (Factory Act 1948), PF, ESIC, and safety protocols—all with one goal in mind: fostering a workplace where people and processes align for growth.

💡 What I Do Best
With hands-on experience managing social compliance audits, ESIC, PF administration, and overseeing health and safety standards, I bring organization and efficiency to every task. Whether it's conducting training, resolving employee grievances, or collaborating across teams, I am committed to raising standards and supporting team welfare.

🌐 Why It Matters
Every organization is built on its people. I believe that by maintaining ethical standards and a positive work culture, businesses don’t just comply—they thrive. A workplace that prioritizes employee well-being, fairness, and opportunity is one that will lead in its industry.

📈 Let’s Connect!
If you’re passionate about creating workplaces that truly care, I’d love to connect. Whether discussing industry insights, innovative HR practices, or compliance trends, I am always open to meaningful conversations that drive change.
